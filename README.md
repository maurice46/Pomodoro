The Pomodoro application is a time management tool designed to enhance productivity by utilizing the Pomodoro Technique. This technique involves working in focused intervals (typically 25 minutes) followed by short breaks, helping users maintain concentration and avoid burnout.

I am creating a Pomodoro Timer with a to-do list below it. It'll be dark-themed, maybe a dark purple.
I am using React for this project. Then I think later on, I'll add a database to keep track of Pomodoro sessions and the to-do list tasks.
