This is a copy of the original one I was working on. For some reason, I kept getting errors and trying to fix things but nothing seemed to work.
So, I transferred all my resources and started "fresh" by creating a new React project and inserting all my work into the last one. 

I am creating a Pomodoro Timer with a to-do list below it. It'll be dark-themed, maybe a dark purple.
I am using React for this project. Then I think later on, I'll add a database to keep track of Pomodoro sessions and the to-do list tasks.

Using Vite (lightweight web server to run react apps).
Frontend Initialization:
1) npm create vite@latest frontend 
2) npm install
3) npm run dev

I will be using Python's Flask, which is a lightweight and flexible web framework.
Allows developers to build web applications quickly and easily. 
It is designed to be simple and easy to use. 

Installation and Setup:
1) pip install Flask
2) mkdir backend
3) cd backend
4) py -3 -m venv .venv
5) .venv\Scripts\activate
